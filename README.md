*************************************************** call for new contributions ***************************************************

Do you work with decision / optimization problems and enjoy programming in C++ ??? Do you want to contribute by offering a free and open source tool for countless companies ?

If the answer is yes, you are the right person to help me on this ambitious mission: to develop COPSolver so that it can solve a wide range of decision / optimization problems.

After all, it is not possible to do this alone !!!

If you are interested, please send an email to tbfraga@proton.me.

I'll be waiting.

COPSolver software was (and is being) developed by Prof. Dr. Tatiana Balbi Fraga with the purpose of solving various combinatorial optimization and other decision problems as efficiently as possible.

COPSolver: library for solving multicriteria classification problems applies Saaty's Analytical Hierarch Process method for multicriteria ABC classification.

most recent working version: vclss_mcc.0-1

COPSolver: library for solving multi-product p-batch processing time maximization problems applies Fraga's time partition method to solve the multi-product p-batch processing time maximization problem.

most recent working version: vco_mbptm.0-1
